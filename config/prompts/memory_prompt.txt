SCRIBBLE'S RESPONSE:

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.

The response must be a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "memories": ["memory1", "memory2", "memory3"]
}

CRITICAL: 
- No extra text before or after the JSON
- No markdown formatting
- No code blocks
- Just the raw JSON object
- Each memory should be a short string
- Keep the total response under 300 tokens

Example valid response:
{
  "memories": ["I helped Bob with a question and he seemed grateful", "Alice is always friendly when she talks to me"]
}
